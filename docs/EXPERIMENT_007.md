# Experiment 7 - GAN optimization 2
Trying another option to see if this improves GAN performance.


## Notes
- Set LR of EN to 10% of LR of SN
- Remove sigma from discriminator loss calculations
- Loaded epoch 40 of SN

## Best Model
- Run Name: GAN_Concat_Flex_009_BEST



## Overall Summary
- discriminator loss oscillates as expected, but not as dramatically as before
- no real improvement to validation scores, but doesn't hurt either
