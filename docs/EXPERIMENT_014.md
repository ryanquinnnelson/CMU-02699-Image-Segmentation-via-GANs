# Experiment 014 - updated ConcatenationFCN architecture
Added ability to have multiple CNN layers in the input block. Require that all FCN blocks start with pooling layer. Going to test against DAN model to see if designs still match.

## Notes
- Run name: ConcatenationFCN-003, ConcatenationFCN-004, ConcatenationFCN-005

## Overall summary
- Adding another pooling layer produces roughly the same performance, at slightly lower memory usage.
